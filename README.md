# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-Tiny-YOLOv2-in-MATLAB
 This project focuses on implementing real-time object detection using MATLAB's Tiny YOLOv2 model. It loads a pretrained network, processes images, and detects objects with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores. The project showcases how to annotate detected objects in an efficient and user-friendly manner.
